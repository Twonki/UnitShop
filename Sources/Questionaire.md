No worries and good luck!

## Technical Questions

Select all correct answers.

[] Tests a single piece of functionality
[] Is written by the developer
[] Should be run only after a big change because of performance
[] should not depend on any other, external resource

[] Should be run with every change of the code

**Which scenario is a Unit-Test?**

Check all common scenarios for a unit-test. 

[] Read and write to a database
[] Testing the distance function of a point to another point
[] Testing whether the `sort()` function of a list sorts the list
[] sending an http-request to an api
[] Testing whether a constructor fails for null-values
[] Checking if a config-file is successfully read

**Which color will a test with a failed assert have?**
