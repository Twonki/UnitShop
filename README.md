# Unit-Test Workshop
This repository contains exercises and presentations for a test-first and unit-test workshop. 

The root folder splits in 4 parts:
- *Sources*, which has the presentation and some further info/help
- *Game*, which has the exercises for the gamified Approach
- *Micro*, which has the exercises for the Micro-Learning Approach
- *Evaluation*, which contains the documents for the evaluation and the test

The Solutions will be either in the folder or in a different branch (the later is preferred).
