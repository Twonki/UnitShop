![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-hotpink.svg)

This repository contains exercises and presentations for a test-first and unit-test workshop. 


## Structure

The root folder splits in 3 parts:

- *Sources*, which has the presentation and some further info/help and the written test. 
- *Game*, which has the exercises for the gamified Approach
- *Micro*, which has the exercises for the Micro-Learning Approach

The solutions are in the regarding folder, in one step further (so the solution of Micro Round 1 can be found in Micro Round 2)
