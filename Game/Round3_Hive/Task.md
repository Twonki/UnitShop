# Round 3: Ant hive

We reached our finale: The ant queen hatches new ants if she got enough food.

The hive is located on a map together with ants and food with differnt locations.
The legend told queen will produce new Ants if the hive collected enough food.

## Requirements Hive
The Hive:

- has a name
- has a point on the map
- has a foodamount
- has a updateMethod
- has a refference to the map

As soon as the updateMethod is called, the hive will consume all food which is located around it and will produce a new ant if the foodamount is greater than 100.

## Helper FakeMap

## Goals

- intensive use of mocks and stubs
- a full idea of how to use tests, mocks and stubs

## ToDo

1. Given the Interface "Map" implement a mockup food called MockMap
2. Implement the Hive and its methods
3. write your tests using your Mockup-MockMap
4. before the time is over, check your tests in
5. check the tests of the enemy team out
6. write code to solve the tests. For the implementations, stick to the interface methods. 
7. cheer, if you win
