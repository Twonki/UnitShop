# Game Rules

To have a fair and nice competition, these are the valid rules.
This document is holy to a degree unfeasable to you.

## Declaring the Winner

1. If a team fouls, the opponent team wins.
2. A round is solved if every (not fouled) test is green.
3. if both teams solve the round, the faster one wins.

Being faster when writing tests does not yield any benefit.

Every test will be shortly checked by the moderator.

Invalid ( = fouled) tests are removed and will not need to be done by the enemy team.  

Being "faster" means the time stamp on the commit. Any time taken by the moderators to control the work does not count into the times.

## Overtime

If both teams have not finished their coding in time, a global overtime is granted.

If no team is finished until the overtime is over, the team with the higher percentage of green tests is declared winner.

## Fouls

The following points are considered fouls:

1. Do not make up requirements. <br>
To have a fair competition, strictly hold to the requirements provided by the regarding *Task.md*. <br>
This foul only leads to removed tests, not to round-wide loose.
2. Disturbing the enemy team. <br>
Either with physical approaches or with unnecessary code/ASCII-Art, etc. <br>
Play fair and stay focussed.
3. (Regarding Overtime Rule) Do not write additional tests if it is your time to write Code
4. The tests given (if not marked as fouled) are not to be altered! <br>
A certain degree of altering (=refactoring) is ok.<br>
This includes:
    - Renaming methods (but not changing their behaviour)
    - Renaming variables (but not changing their type)
    - Renaming the Tests
5. Invalid Java - This is a necessary requirement so everyone CAN achieve the tests. <br>
This foul only leads to removed tests. If there are minimal problems, the moderators may fix the test. <br>
You may ask your moderators on help how to express yourself.
6. Using 3rd Party Libraries. Only Java Standard is valid. <br>
Java is Turing complete, so you should be good.
7. Writing impossible tests

## Overtime in writing tests

If both teams need more time to write tests, a global overtime is given.

Any test which is **completed** after the (over-)time will be marked as fouled.
